## **Backstory**:

Maribel grew up in Santa Lucina, born to Eugenia Cardoso and in Vanessa’s shadow, quite literally. Maribel followed her older sister everywhere and Vanessa was extremely protective of her little sister. Eugenia worked as an assistant to the cheapest jeweler in town and was judgemental, overprotective, and strict with her daughters, but she had a soft spot for Maribel. Vanessa often got the brunt of Eugenia’s aggression, typically without Maribel’s awareness. Vanessa also gained the reputation of “wild child”, but this was advantageous to Maribel, as she was typically left alone to her studies as a result. 

As they grew up, Maribel and Vanessa got used to lying for each other to Eugenia to escape her unrealistic expectations. Maribel was used to being the mediator between Eugenia and Vanessa when things got ugly, often comforting Eugenia through the night after Vanessa would storm out. Fed up with her circumstances living under Eugenia’s roof, Vanessa got a job as a courtesan when she was seventeen and Maribel was twelve. Vanessa’s best friend and Eugenia’s boss’ son, Tamazi, and Maribel helped her keep her job a secret. She hoped to raise enough money so that she and Maribel could leave and have a place of their own. One day when Maribel got home from school, Eugenia told her that Vanessa was no longer allowed in her house and there would be new rules in place. It took a couple months for her to actually enforce these rules, but they were explained regardless. 

Maribel was expected to keep to a strict curfew, let Eugenia vet anyone (and their parents) if she brought someone home or visited their house, assist Eugenia with her job when the school day ended, and was not allowed to date, be sexually active, or participate in extracurricular activities. Since all Maribel really did was study and read, even during her lunch and free periods at school, she did not mind the restrictions. When she turned sixteen, she was expected to take on Vanessa’s chores. Upon graduating, she was expected to help Eugenia out with her job on the weekends as well as during the week. This did not last long, as Maribel got her own job shortly after she turned eighteen. Once she had her own job, Eugenia relaxed on her rules somewhat, but Maribel paid part of the rent in return. That is when she started socializing with Tamazi in secret, often claiming she took on extra hours at work, which was typically true regardless. 

Vanessa mailed letters to Maribel and Tamazi throughout the years, but nothing to Eugenia. If she needed to send something to Maribel that Eugenia could not see, she would send it to Tamazi. One day, Eugenia explicitly forbade Maribel from receiving any mail from Vanessa or sending her anything. She would only say that Vanessa had gotten involved with dangerous people and that Eugenia would not have Maribel become like her sister. That day, Maribel was able to meet with Tamazi and received her final letter from Vanessa. She had him send one more letter back to her, but neither of them received anything since.

~~

Maribel patiently waited out Eugenia’s remaining life span, secretly making plans while she did so. She even gained a side gig, with Tamazi’s assistance, that earned her extra money Eugenia was unaware of and would potentially help her reach Vanessa. The day Eugenia passed, Maribel settled her mother’s affairs and pursued a pact with [redacted]. She was technically successful in this, but it would take her time to earn what she wanted out of the deal. Before she set out to search for Vanessa, Maribel bade goodbye to Tamazi, her only friend left in Santa Lucina.

Due to her fascination with history, geography, and anthropology, Maribel took her time traveling. She completed tasks from [redacted] and looked for clues for Vanessa’s whereabouts while she explored. Her patron became her only consistent companion, even though they had only been tied together for a short time. While she would claim that she would only converse to fill the silence when [redacted] would ask, Maribel secretly admitted to herself that she cherished the company. She utilized her side gig to look for Vanessa, as well as contribute to her part of the pact.

Eventually, for whatever reason, Maribel believed Kalighar was the best place to look for clues next. As she made her way there, she sent her first letter to Tamazi:

> *Zi,*
> *I heard Kalighar might be the place to find Vanessa. I’ll write when I have definitive information one way or the other.*
> *Mari*
