## **Backstory**:

Aztrid “Skid” Skwall grew up in the Tartarus Quarter of Saturday Island under the care of a reformed convict human, Barrith Skwall, who was her legal guardian. Astrid has lived and worked in her father's VT repair shop for most of her life. Her fascination with how these devices run has led to her becoming a tinkerer in her own right, finding that she can use the stored arcane magical energies to create solid objects. 

One of her favorite things is music, as she found that the “vibe” of what she plays affects what she can create. She, with her father’s help, created a pair of tape decks that she could one day wield in the End tournament. 

Her desire to compete were not a secret, and the fights that would play on the various VTs in their store would mesmerize the employees of the shop, as they stopped working in order to cheer on their favorite. Those cheers, that adulation, was something she has coveted. She loves the people that work for her dad like family, and she wants to hear them cheering her name someday, and maybe someday all of Kalighar as well. 

Her father is contained within the dungeon, and Aztrid wants to win the fights now for more than just her own glory, but to keep her father and those like him safe.
