# Frenzy

BlazBlue, Guilty Gear, the King of Fighters, Skullgirls, Street Fighter, and so many other Fighting Games include Super Moves, a special kind of ability that requires you to consume some of the game's resource bar to use. These abilities are exceptionally powerful and essential to the gameplay loop of certain characters. Since Kalighar is inspired by Fighting Games, we'll have something very similar to Super Moves—the **Frenzy Actions**. Frenzy Actions are Special Actions granted by a special feat, your **Frenzy Origin Feat**. Let's check one out, for example!

**Hellion's Frenzy** is a **Frenzy Origin Feat** granted to the character "Rekxis." Every character will have their own "Frenzy." After rolling for Initiative, all characters with a Frenzy Origin Feat gain one (1) **Frenzy Point**, up to a maximum of five (5) Frenzy Points. You can carry these Frenzy Points throughout the day as you face more and more battles, but these all go away at the end of a Long Rest. You also gain additional Frenzy Points when a certain condition is met. Each Frenzy Origin Feat has its own conditions for gaining Frenzy Points.

As you can see, Hellion's Frenzy has **two main conditions**—Rekxis has to either use his Bardic Inspiration on an ally, and that ally has to use it to turn a failed attack or physical saving throw into a successful one OR he has to cause other creatures to move about in his own turn. Causing either condition to be met awards him with one Frenzy Point. Furthermore, he has a **"seasonal" condition**, which will change with each **Season** and **Special Episode**, to keep things fresh. The current seasonal condition, "AMP IT!", awards Rekxis with a Frenzy Point every time he uses his Bardic Inspiration, and the ally inspired rolls the highest number possible on the Bardic Inspiration dice. Here's the fun part, though! After a Season ends, a character can choose to **swap** one of their **main conditions** for their **"seasonal" condition**, making that a **new main condition**. As this is our first time working with them, we can negotiate changes to the conditions as necessary.

And what do I use these Frenzy Points for? You can use them to perform **Frenzy Maneuvers** (Martial-inclined characters) and cast **Frenzy Spells** (Spellcaster-inclined characters). These special abilities are considered **Frenzy Actions**; they're **neither actions nor Bonus Actions**, and they can only be used **once per turn on your turn**. Each character starts with **two Frenzy Actions**, one that costs **3 Frenzy Points** and one that costs **5 Frenzy Points**. Pay close attention to some of these Frenzy Actions, though, for some of them might feature special mechanics, including the upcoming **Install** and **Punish** keywords!

**Frenzy Actions** with the **Install** keywords last longer. Once you perform a Frenzy Maneuver or cast a Frenzy Spell with the Install mechanic, you'll create a **Clock** with a certain number of **empty sections**. At the end of each one of your turns, you fill one **section** of your Clock. The **Install** lasts until the **last section is filled**, and it provides you and/or the party a major buff. **Frenzy Actions** with the **Punish** keyword can be used **out of your turn**. You can use them as normal on your turn, but you can use them as a **Reaction** instead. Usually, **Frenzy Actions** with the **Punish** keyword are going to have **additional effects** if they're performed outside of your turn.

On Character Level 5, characters are going to gain a **third "seasonal" Frenzy Action**, which costs **10 Frenzy Points**! But how will you pay for them if you can only have a maximum of 5 Frenzy Points? Well, sharing is caring! Kind of. This special "seasonal" Frenzy Action has the **"Partner with"** keyword, which means you must expend not only your total of 5 Frenzy Points, but also your "partner's" 5. Like the seasonal conditions, these special Frenzy Actions rotate with the seasons, and you can replace your current main Frenzy Actions for a weaker version of the seasonal one, which will lack the "Partner with" keyword.
