In addition to the Super Moves (see [[Mechanics/Frenzy/Frenzy Overview\|Frenzy Overview]]), I also couldn't forget to add one thing every Fighting Game hasâ€”**Stages**! Though they're not usually relevant to the gameplay loop of most Fighting Games, I wanted to take the chance to make something out of the stuff we've tried out in Journey to Vastvale and one of the core mechanics of D&D: Lair Effects. Labrys is a large city, and although there are creatures powerful enough to set up Lairs inside this megalopolis, the Elysian Field makes sure that every place in Labrys has the potential to become a minute "Lair," one that is under no one but fate's control.

The Fields don't alter every battlefield into a Stage, only those particularly interesting. This means that only certain encounters happen under "Stages." To better understand what a Stage is, let's check one of them: "Blame Game."

"Blame Game" is the premiere Stage effect of Saturday Island. It is exclusive to that district and cannot happen anywhere else for now. It's not the only Stage effect in the district, but it's the one I chose to illustrate what a Stage effect is. You'll also notice it says "Season 1," meaning that this current effect is limited to Season 1 of Kalighar 99.9. Further interactions with "Blame Game" might be altered by the current season, namely, updating its impact so that it continues to be relevant to your current level. This includes additional damage or higher severity of condition effects.

To help smooth the experience, every Stage will be automated as much as possible. For example, both the "WANTED" state and the accompanying penalty of triggering the Stage's consequences are automatically applied to each character.
