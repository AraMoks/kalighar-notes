As night descends over Labrys, the lights of a certain district turn into a distinct shade of black and red. Lustful hands welcome the champions back home, their palms like poison, their nails like claws. A banquet of delicacies awaits them, a delicious feast for the most delicious guests. Servants in the finest of uniforms doff their masters' bloodied armors and clothes—not their masters' blood, no, never. No one reaches the top by bleeding themselves dry. In the deepest, darkest hour, their minds return to that realm unknown to time and space. Their most hateful, heinous, unredeemable thoughts, lost in the maze of the mind, do not concern them. "Other people do worse," they say. "Why does it matter? It's just a game," they say. "I deserve this; I deserve this and better," they say. It's difficult to see the abyss of one's own making after being on the top for so long.

Welcome to Kings' Row, the red light district of Labrys.

"Everyone who is someone lives in Kings' Row," or at least that's what the "new money" people say. Constructed as a concerted effort of its reigning faction, Kings' Row offers only "the best of the best" that Labrys has to offer. The best buildings, the finest fighters, the hottest "hotties," the list goes on and on until one falls for it. Kings' Row is luxury incarnate. But it is also a place of contrasts. The highest point in the district, Averardo Skyscraper, is an impossible skyscraper containing multiple rooms and halls. Alcohol falls out of the building like a golden waterfall and reaches the dark dead ends below like poison. Laughter echoes throughout the building, so loud and rambunctious that it silences the sound of desperate wailings. The people who reach the top of Averardo—the top of Kings' Row—do everything possible to stay there, but fate is a fickle thing, and to lose all that was gained, all one needs is a push off the ledge.

I wouldn't call Kings' Row the worst place to live in Labrys by a mile, but as with any deal with the devil, it's always asking for something in return. "Keep up the appearances," they say. "Do not let them know your hand," they say. Everyone in Kings' Row either knows the game or lies about it, and that's fair. "Fake it 'till you make it," I guess. It's why Kings' Row is so small, I fear. Not everyone in Labrys wants to play their little "game." But if you ever want to commit some mistakes, financial or otherwise, count me in for some fun at Kings' Row. I'd rather taste its transitory delights than "the everlasting glory" that its casinos offer.

### House Domino

The spark of rebellion ignited by the Frontier Brigade shone in the hearts of ten warbands. Each of them had their own reasons for wanting to topple the old regime. Their members fought on the sidelines, using subterfuge and treachery to weaken the Compagnia and reach Kalighus unnoticed. Yes, the rebellion knew how to work in the shadows, but only because someone else knew how to beckon the God-Tyrant's attention. One of the ten warbands, a particularly infamous one, claimed that the rebellion's plan, crazy as it was, had some chance of success, and its members gambled on that slim chance. The warband launched a terrifying war campaign, attacking multiple enemies simultaneously. The leader held the _victor's vow_ in hand as a decoy while the rest of the rebels amassed resources and support. Kalighus had no choice but to watch the upstarts with utmost attention, until he realized that their little "show" was just a diversion, and that the next stop on their little "tour" was Castle Decim.

That warband liked to topple its enemies in sequence, each one falling like dominoes. Yes, like dominoes. The warband liked dominoes. After its dissolution, the members founded House Domino, using the gold and resources gained as spoils of war to build themselves a home—Averardo. The House spent its wealth well, roped several other fearsome warbands under their banner, and became the richest faction in Labrys, second to no one...until LABS came and ruined everything, but that's not the point. Within the urban environment, House Domino had to find some other way to assert dominance over Labrys. And what way is better than to become the city's business moguls? If a business glitters like gold, it's because House Domino opened or supported it. The members appreciate the finest things in life and maintain a lifestyle that few can afford without the support of one of their leaders. Yes, boundless generosity runs in their blood, but so does bloody retribution. The House expects to always win, and thus, if a member fails to meet their expectations or betrays them for the sake of someone else, they become vulnerable to "termination." The much, much worse kind of "termination."

Although House Domino likes the spotlight, it has learned the value of working in the shadows. Blessed be the teachings of the past. Sometimes, members of the House go to the tunnels of Junkyard Junction to conduct illicit businesses. The House washes the hands of the Sigilswarm Market, their closest business partner in the underworld, in exchange for helping them traverse the Junction. The Sigilswarm knows that their "partner" sometimes throws them under the bus, but it's fine so long as the recompense is worth their while. Otherwise, the Sigilswarm has no qualms in calling on the House's enemies. For instance, when the relationship between the two factions sours, the Sigilswarm usually calls upon the Knights of the New Age, who find the House's debauchery "uncourtly," or the Godpunk Gangs, who also get thrown under the same bus, to mess with their meetings. The Godpunks, lacking patience and subtlety, will usually attack both parties with no second thought, but the Knights use...other unusual means to stop the meeting. A Knight might try to persuade the House members to call the meeting off, pointing out the consequences that said illicit businesses might elicit in the districts, all the while proselytizing about "redemption." Much to the Sigilswarm's amusement, though, the Knights do sometimes succeed in "redeeming" a House member, often turning them into one of their fabled "black Knights," much to House Domino's dismay. It's difficult to "terminate" someone with the knowledge of their tactics and the support of a faction like the Knights.
