"To survive is enough," was one of the mottos of the wars. Those who indulged in it always came in first, while the rest had to weather the slaughter. So, when the wars were over and people laid the first brick foundations of Labrys, a new motto was born—"To survive is not enough, we must now learn how to live." Life became the ultimate impetus, the reason for being. Let it breathe over this dead world and turn its wheel of fate. Let it paint a thousand shades over the land so that it knows colors other than red.

Welcome to Carolina Boulevard, the noble district of Labrys.

Labrys was built through the efforts of the survivors of the wars, and a noninsignificant number of those people wanted nothing to do with combat ever again. While the war bands dissolved into factions and waged their little turf wars over the city, those with the resources to sequester themselves in their "little Eden" did so with little to no notice. That's how Carolina Boulevard came to be. Labrys's wealthiest citizens—either those who accumulated a lot of spoils or who capitalized on new markets—built Carolina Boulevard as a "sanctuary" amid the chaos of Labrys's urban landscape. The district is, for the most part, a planned one, down to the last detail. Each magnificent manor and palatial apartment bears the weight of the ages. It weighs a fortune in old gold, the finest of its kind. Her people don't walk but dance through life, the finest life, the most opulent life, one that cannot be attained overnight, no matter how much one gambles at Kings' Row nor _wishes_ at the End-Tournament.

But what if one does, though? I said that Carolina Boulevard is, for the most part, a planned district, but it houses a place so chaotic that it's been a point of contention for its residents for decades—Rutland Park. In 15 NA, contestant Dominic Rutland, an air elementalist, won the Tournament to End All Tournaments and _wished_ for something that changed Carolina Boulevard forever. He said, "I _wish_ for a place for people to rest after a long week of work." Back then, most of the residents of Carolina Boulevard weren't workers but bosses who wanted nothing to do with "the rabble," who were the only ones who stood to benefit from this _wish_. But it didn't matter, for his _wish_ had been of the soul. In the middle of the district, a lush patch of woodland appeared out of thin air, so beautiful it looked as though someone had painted it over. People came to this woodland and watched as a beast of cinder and smoke rose out of an Elemental Junction, howling and summoning three other Elemental Junctions to wash the park with life eternal, chaotic, imperfect, indelible. Wasn't it the people's _wish_ to turn Carolina Boulevard into a "sanctuary?" Or was it meant for someone else? It didn't matter now, for in defiance of that false "sanctuary," Dominic Rutland carved one for himself and for everyone else.

### Gearheart Institute

War is no place for weaklings, and when a warband is lacking in combat, it must supplant that weakness with something else. Some, like the warband that'd become the Oneiros Dreamscapers, supplanted it with trickery and treachery. In contrast, others, like the one that'd become the Sigilswarm Market, relied on their craftiness to come out ahead. In the eternal question on how to fight, this war band chose the most unusual answer of all—don't. TThe chests Kalighus bestowed upon each warband every war contained some medical supplies, but most warbands were expected to suffer casualties, both lesser (like the loss of a limb) and major (death). Since healing magic was restricted to those who had been blessed by Kalighus himself, most warbands had to rely on "root magic" with a dash of science—alchemical concoctions, herbal medicine, etc. One such warband was rather good at it. Their members survived out of sheer resilience. "Survive, and outlive all," they said. Their headquarters were a small fort in No Man's Land, and their members exchanged healing and medicine for peace and resources to help them survive and outlive. So, when the rebellion came knocking at their door asking for doctors to heal Kalighar of its most lethal disease, the whole war band rose to their aid.

Although their participation in the final confrontation was negligible, their aid in the aftermath was indispensable. Their medicine was nothing short of miraculous. They were one of the first war bands to dissolve upon the formation of the factions, and their members—with the support of the population—founded Gearheart Institute, a medical research facility and public hospital for the citizens of Labrys. So famous was their medicine that the Gearheart Institute became one of the three major factions to house a host of Celestials, alongside the Knights of the New Age and Saturday Saints Security.

Gearheart Institute isn't just a hospital, however. Most people who join the Institute become part of its medical team. The medical team—the doctors, nurses, and pharmacists of the faction—heals their patients with minimal magic involved. The Institute has access to some magical healing through its angelic members, but has dedicated itself to studying non-magical options. Others join as members of its support team, which itself is split into two. While part of the support team participates in the exhibition matches, showcasing the Institute's medical equipment and angelic armaments to the audience, the other part of the team works in the major leagues as the End Tournament's official first aid rescue team. In either case, the support team also acts as medical counselors, overseeing each participant's health, and as medical suppliers, selling medicinal items like antidotes and potions at baseline cost.

Gearheart Institute has a peculiar relationship with the scientists of PAЯADOX. PAЯADOX's research on aliens fascinates some doctors and pushes others to the edge of madness. These maddened doctors push their research to the limit, either finding exciting new results in their madness or losing themselves in it. Some members of Sigilswarm Market loathe the doctors of Gearheart Institute for their elitism. It's a well-known fact that the Institute offers its best doctors and medicine to the wealthiest patients. In defiance of the Institute, the Sigilswarm Market has begun a campaign to push independent or Sigilswarm-allied alchemists to pull Gearheart Institute's hegemonic domain back down to earth. If I had to put it, it's like the medical faction is infected with a disease of its own. While the Sigilswarm plans to expose this disease, House Domino plans to exploit it. The House supports the Institute, which has no reason to suspect their ill intent, all the while banking on the Sigilswarm's rage to push the Institute off its high horse. Then, the House can swoop in and "rescue" the "rescuers," claiming all the benefits for themselves alone. Thus far, no faction other than the Knights suspects their master plan.
