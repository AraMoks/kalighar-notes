Slick, colorful slime colors the walls of old, decrepit buildings. Aqueducts slither in and out of the neighborhoods, fantastical hanging canals built for someone unknown. Beggars hide in the alleyways, gazing hesitantly at the starry night, their eyes like doors into the nothingness of space. As night falls, the district awakens. The slime stirs and devours all clues that'd solve the mystery behind this madness. The aqueducts animate and hunt for prey, like snakes in the jungle. The stars return the gaze and open the door to our world, to meet its audience. Daybreak comes, and the district falls asleep again.

Welcome to Zener Hazard, the waterfront district of Labrys.

Like Overlook Harbor, Zener Hazard is one of the most fascinating places in Labrys. Due to several incidents, Zener Hazard has fallen out of favor as the city's primary port, with Overlook Harbor now taking its place. To be honest, Zener Hazard has always been a weird spot. Ever since its construction, something—someone—lurks in this district. Someone who is far too old and powerful. Anomalies happen all the time—"crop circles" in the park, mysterious sigils in the walls, unidentified signals in the radio, and VT channels that shouldn't exist, those that go beyond the known 100 channels. Most of the residents don't think too much about it; Kalighar is a weird, wild world after all. But sometimes, something so odd and unexpected will happen—a fanciful "airship" that abducts people, a building that disappears out of thin air, a doppelganger that has assumed someone else's life entirely. And no one seems to notice or remember. Like Overlook Harbor, something has taken hold of the district, blanketing it with a curse of skepticism.

Look for the signs in places whose sense of "normalcy" waxes and wanes like the sun and the moon. Drifter's Park is always abuzz with unusual activity at all times of the day, despite the S.S.S.'s constant surveillance of the area. Places like the old "Syr Saturn's Super Fun Amusement Park" might appear normal—if not a bit desolate—at first, but wait until nighttime to meet some of its unusual "visitors." You don't need to wait until nighttime to meet a "visitor," either. Just go to the Tipsy-Turvy bar in the intersection between Zener Hazard and Junkyard Junction. Although I suppose its owner is no longer a "visitor," but a "resident," after spending a decade serving the loudest customers Zener Hazard has to offer. It's possible for a "visitor" to become a "citizen," with full citizenship rights, though this is almost always due to the intervention of a certain meddlesome faction.

### PAЯADOX

Mana, as we know it, was scarce in the Age of War. Only Kalighus's most fervent faithful had access to magic, and other fonts of mana were inaccessible for most people. But this faction wasn't "most people." The warband had "benefactors" who supplied the members with unique spells. The Compagnia hunted those who made pacts with eldritch entities, but despite their best efforts, the paladins could never eliminate this warband. Once, some of the "benefactors" intervened on their behalf and took them to a place among the stars. These eldritch entities had their own agenda, but foiling the God-Tyrant's plan was a common thread among them. In the final war, this warband rode with the rebels, calling on their "benefactors" to rain comets down on the persecutors. "Blast them off into the sun," like some silly Saturday morning cartoon. "They'll soon be seeing stars," OK, I'll stop.

Come to think of it, PAЯADOX was quite war-like in the past. The warband had no qualms about summoning minute black holes or causing localized supernovas on the battlefield if it meant getting them out of combat faster. In the aftermath of the last war, PAЯADOX joined the other rebels in founding Labrys and helped build its waterfront district. PAЯADOX needed access to the waters to do some of their rituals, but I don't think it knew that amidst the stars, entities other than their "benefactors" would gaze upon the district. Indeed, PAЯADOX didn't—or rather, couldn't—know about the oddities that'd assail Zener Hazard. Back then, their function was to learn, research, and teach magic to the citizens of Labrys, a role that has now been assumed by the Sleepstone Institute. No, PAЯADOX has another function. The faction's scientists research anomalies—magical, space, and time. Their members catalogue frequent anomalies, research anomalous spaces, and fight against ill-intentioned "visitors," all the while struggling against "the blanket of skepticism" that covers all of Zener Hazard. Yes, the faction has an unusual reputation, for all the good the scientists do to Zener Hazard, most of it goes unnoticed.

PAЯADOX has little to no allies among the major factions of Labrys. It fights this battle alone. But among the other major factions, it finds solace among the Oneiros Dreamscapers, who understand a thing or two about "anomalous spaces." The scientific approach PAЯADOX has to their district's oddities doesn't fit neatly with the Dreamscapers' holistic view. Still, when the unexplainable needs to be eliminated rather than explained, both factions come to mutual aid. "Visitors" that come to Labrys don't land just on Zener Hazard, sometimes they land on Avery Lane. The Knights of the New Age, who oversee that suburban district, seldom notice that their "new neighbor" is, in fact, a shapeshifting alien hellbent on replacing Humanoids with others of its species. PAЯADOX doesn't know how to negotiate with the Knights, who believe the faction is just biased against "foreigners." Sometimes, PAЯADOX gets the support of Starlight Studios, though that faction has second intentions. Their memetic magic is helpful against "the blanket of skepticism," and the members of Starlight Studios don't question them much. However, the faction doesn't do this out of genuine concern. Starlight Studios wants to film those damn "aliens," of course!
