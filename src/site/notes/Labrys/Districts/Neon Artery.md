Imagine this: Labrys, 001 NA, the Elysian Fields, welcoming a thousand survivors of the wars—the first citizens—to the Tournament to End All Tournaments. These people clung to the Elysian Fields like kids clinging to their mother in a thunderstorm. It was comforting, of course, but the building was finite. Now, imagine this: Labrys, 015 NA, the population has jumped into the thousands. Gearheart Institute has helped complete the construction of Carolina Boulevard, and the S.S.S. has begun reconstructing the dungeon into a habitable district. And as the eighth district concluded its construction, these thousands of people turned their attention back to the Elysian Fields, "back home." And so, every road that led back to it, every gap in every district, became a district in and of itself, pumping the Elysian Fields with the blood of newcomers, their hearts and souls ablaze with glory. 

Welcome to Neon Artery, the industrial district of Labrys.

Neon Artery has a unique layout among the districts of Labrys. It exists in the "gaps" between each district, bleeding into the space of others like a piece of graffiti, competing for space among others on a wall. As such, it has no simple classification. It is what it is, a collection of roads and "gaps" that together form a whole. The district became the main "road" of Labrys, through which people come to Labrys, its ten districts, and the Elysian Fields. The additional infrastructural work on the Artery also helped with "transit," both the transit of people, goods, and information—the ætherworks cables, buses, cabs, rails, mailmen, and the VT signal transmission, which now reaches over 75% of the Outlands, thank fates. So, if you ever wonder how certain things ever end up in the most unusual places in the Outlands, it's probably because an Artery resident got it there.

With such diverse functions, it's no wonder the Artery became such a point of contention in Labrys. As I've mentioned, Neon Artery bleeds into other districts, and thus, the residents of these "bleeds" must contend with the adversities of the different districts. For instance, the residents of the Artery near Avery Lane must construct their houses according to the district's strict HOA guidelines. Residents on the Artery near Zener Hazard must not ride after dark, for UFOS could abduct them and/or replace their vehicles with wild mimics.

### Godpunk Gangs

Most warbands were nomads by necessity, traversing Kalighar in search of resources and other warbands with whom to battle and raid. But among those warbands, there was one that was particularly infamous in its horseback raids. It liked to raid others at random, coming to their headquarters, raiding all in a burst of action, and disappearing into the countryside on horseback. Their horses, monstrous mutant horses in fact, were prized possessions that were sometimes exchanged for benefits with other competitors. The Frontier Brigade, who had been the war band's allies and victims time and again, called them to join the rebellion, inciting them with "the ultimate raid," which was enough to rope them into their battle against the God-Tyrant. The war band dashed through Castle Decim inciting as much chaos as possible, enough to let the Brigade enter its inner sanctum unnoticed.

That warband became the Godpunk Gangs, a ragtag band of racing gangs that race through the Artery nightly. Each "gang" of the Godpunk Gangs has a gang leader with personal aesthetic sensibilities, agenda, and racing motto. The faction has an "ultimate leader," but leadership is rather transitory—if the leader loses a special racing challenge to another gang's leader, that leader becomes the Godpunks' "ultimate leader." The Godpunks mostly keep it to themselves, causing some chaos and mischief in other districts for the fun of it. Otherwise, the faction also deals in æthermobilitics. The Godpunks were instrumental in the rise of æthermobiles—cars, motorcycles, and whatever else the Godpunks can put ætherburners, galvanic steel chassis, lightwheels, and so forth on. Hells, I don't put it past them to put wheels on their favorite diners and mechanic hotspots.

The Godpunk Gangs respect the crew of the _Mavromichalis 190_ as brothers in the path of trailblazing. The Godpunks trailblaze the city, while the _Mavromichalis 190_ trailblazes the Outlands. Some of the equipment on the _god-warmachina_ is, in fact, part of resource exchanges between both factions. The crew wants to find some time to participate in the Ætherfront Grand Prix to show the Godpunks some support on their tournament. Saturday Saints Security reserves its harshest punishments for the Godpunks, whose lack of restraint and opinion that "speed limits don't exist" endanger all. The Godpunks think the guards need to lighten up, and that no one (who matters) has ever suffered a (lethal) accident as a result of their racing (that S.S.S. knows). The Sigilswarm Market looks up to the Godpunks as a faction that helped their district come into being in the past. Both factions maintain amicable relationships despite their different agendas. They're also both connected to the Mavromichalis 190, though again, through other reasons. The Sigilswarm sponsors the Grand Prix and supplies the Godpunks with vehicle parts, while the Godpunks help them watch over the tunnels of Junkyard Junction.
