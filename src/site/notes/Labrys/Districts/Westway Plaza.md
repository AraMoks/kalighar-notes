Every day, over 30,000 people pass by this district, their footsteps one and the same with the music of the urban musicians, the minstrels of the New Age. The day is longer, the night is sweeter, the stars glimmer for the people in this realm below. People walk close to blockbuster legends, to stars of the battles, to icons of the charts. "Reach for the stars," they say; "It's our birthright," they say. We were people with no expectations in life, no chance to be anything else but weapons. But not anymore. Today, we raise our banners high to the legends of tomorrow. To the actors who entertain our deepest fantasies, to the fighters who show us we can still fight our good fight and win, to the musicians who pull us into the depths of their melodies. Let those legends become our guiding stars and lead us forward into the indelible moments of the New Age. Let the biggest show on Labrys begin!

Welcome to Westway Plaza, the commercial district of Labrys.

"Every star in Labrys has a place in Westway Plaza," is its advertisement line. Westway Plaza is the de facto "downtown" of Labrys, a district full of excitement, and the birthplace of the most popular artifact of all—the VTs. It's a district that combines both old and new designs, bold fashion statements, and unique music genres into a fabulous, phenomenal phenomenon. This is what the New Age is all about—trying out new things, seeing what sticks, adding some hip to each hop. Westway Plaza was constructed with the cosmos in mind: the sun and the moon each shine clearly on their casting calls, the sun making the district seem gleaming and fantastical, and the moon filling the minds of its residents with radiant insight. As a district that dictates what is or isn't fashionable and popular, Westway Plaza exists on the edge between the fictional and the fantastical. Buildings with outlandish designs, fashionistas with uncomfortable clothing, musicians singing songs of other lands—it's difficult for certain things to find a space within the hearts and souls of people. Still, those who do, and those who helped them earn that spot, get their place among the stars of the district.

Attention is the name of the game in Westway Plaza, and thus, it is the district with the highest amount of minor factions competing for attention. These minor factions, most of which compete in the End Tournament, raise their banners high for the audience and their fan base, competing amongst each other on the local stage. The main faction of Westway Plaza doesn't mind the additional competition; in fact, it supports them! After all, all these factions make the Plaza a compelling place to spend time and watch some matches. And if a minor faction falls out of the spotlight, perhaps one can offer a helping hand and get them back in the game—but now, under their name.

### Starlight Studios

While the warband that'd become Oneiros Dreamscapers engaged in misinformation campaigns, another warband saw the radio as a chance to do something different throughout the war. First, the members used it to maintain their high moods. A soldier with peace of mind was deadlier than one filled with fear and worry. Their "radio-minstrels" read out tales and sang out songs that kept the environment light. Sometimes, other warbands would stumble upon their channels and catch the end of these exchanges. "Maniacs," they thought. But these maniacs competed in the wars, after all, and each time the radio was on, the soldiers were getting vital information disguised in song. It took weeks for the rebellion to locate them and persuade them to join their cause. Once it did, the rebels had not one but two warbands that specialized in media manipulation, and with their combined efforts, no one could get through their intelligence team. No one but me.

After the fall of Kalighus and the dissolution of the ten major warbands, the warband that'd become Oneiros Dreamscapers disappeared out of public view, while the one that'd become Starlight Studios stepped into the spotlight. Starlight Studios became responsible for Labrys's first major radio channel...and then it became the faction responsible for all the major channels (both for radio and VT), district stages, theater houses, theme parks, and so on. Starlight Studios wasn't just a giant of the entertainment industry—it became the industry itself. With the help of the memothopters, Starlight Studios became ubiquitous in Labrys. Its actors star in blockbuster films, the exhibition fighters dazzle audiences of tens of thousands, and the musicians manage to top the charts of other planes. Success is excess, and no excess is too much excess for the members of Starlight Studios.

Now, when it comes to allegiances, things get tricky. All in all, the Knights of the New Age love to "star" in the films of Starlight Studios. All the Knights need to do is let the memothopters get some good footage of them fighting against a hapless House Domino member or a random urban monster, and Starlight Studios will do the rest. The magic is in the IFX (illusion effects). Though the Knights seldom refuse to be filmed, the same can't be said about the Dreamscapers of Oneiros Dreamscapers, whose opinion on the Studios is a complicated one. Most Dreamscapers like their stuff—it's the best in the market, after all—and let some of them perform in the Grand Anderson Hotel. However, their memetic magic has unusual effects on the supernatural elements of Overlook Harbor, causing them to become agitated and unstable. The hauntings of the district can inhabit memotapes and duplicate ad infinitum, so long as the first memotape remains. Starlight Studios' higher-ups refuse to listen to reason, which means the Dreamscapers often find themselves opposing them not out of loathing, but out of need. In the world of entertainment, House Domino is the Studios' final boss—the faction that claimed Kings' Row has its own entertainment team that fights over channel space with Starlight Studios. Their rivalry is legendary and is, in itself, a spectacle worth watching. Should their differences ever be put aside, something—an exhibition match, a film, a performance—will come out of them that will change the foundations of this world forever.
