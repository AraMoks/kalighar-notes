Like a child who wants to become an adult faster, the people of Labrys built things upward, with buildings and skyscrapers evolving into fabulous apartments and unreachable penthouses. However, these high-end houses, often located in these high-end districts, were not affordable to ordinary citizens. The shadows cast by these buildings were terrifying to behold, so, like teenagers rebelling against their elders, the ordinary citizens drifted away to the outskirts of town. These citizens built nice homes with nice backyards that were distant and different from the adults' homes but still similar enough so that others could see the resemblance. And then came the rails so that the teenagers could go visit the adults. And with the rails came the others, who also wanted to build a new home with the teenagers. And when the teenagers welcomed these others with apple pies and gossip, they realized they had become adults.

Welcome to Avery Lane, the suburban district of Labrys.

Avery Lane is a major residential district in the city of Labrys. In addition to an endless sea of houses, Avery Lane has several major buildings known as _the Stairways to Heaven_. These haloed, alabaster skyscrapers exist on the edges of the district and are the residence of the angels, who came to Kalighar after Kalighus's fall. The halos spin like the blades of a windmill, causing subtle tailwinds that help the angels and some other species traverse the district and reach downtown Labrys swiftly. The houses on Avery Lane are distinctly detached and often include a backyard or front yard. People here tend to form tight-knit communities, helping one another through thick and thin, all the while gossiping about everyone else's lives.

In the summertime, the district truly comes to life. As schools close for vacation, children come out of their homes very early to play in the backyard or with their friends. Teenagers, on the other hand, disappear for hours on end, either going to the mall at some district, to the stadiums for some rough fun, or to their special place in Labrys, a place that might not be special for anyone but it means the world to them. The sounds of afternoon chatter with chardonnay, of bicycles and skateboards, of the ice cream truck approaching are what make Avery Lane such a special place in a city like Labrys.

### Knights of the New Age

The reigning faction of Avery Lane is the Knights of the New Age. Rumor has it that this faction, in its time as a warband, was quite chivalrous. The members, like the Frontier Brigade's, seldom participated in the senseless bloodshed of the Great Wars unless their foe was particularly infamous or if their "honor" had been smeared somehow. As the warband dissolved into the faction, its members began to stylize themselves after the knights of yore with fancy armor, titles, and all. I thought the faction would be assimilated into Saturday Saints Security, but the Knights like to do things...the old-fashioned way.

To make it simple, the Knights of the New Age defend Labrys much like a knight would defend its kingdom and her people. The Knights like to protect citizens from "evildoers," such as robbers who attack victims in darkened alleyways or monsters who sneak into the districts of Labrys, using magical emblems, elegant muskets, and fine-crafted swords in combat. So what is the difference between them and the guards of Saturday Saints Security? The Knights can't apprehend people, nor absolve or condemn them based on nonsensical things like "feelings, sense of what is right, and vows of redemption," despite their numerous attempts to do so. So, when the Knights aren't interfering with Saturday's job, they're out there helping others with house chores or odd jobs in exchange for favors. These favors help the Knights maintain a good reputation in all districts of Labrys, all the while roping people up on their chivalrous cavalcade.

Out of all the major factions, the Knights of the New Age relate the most to the guards of Saturday Saints Security, but it isn't reciprocated. The Knights value the guards' efforts in keeping Labrys safe, but the guards see the Knights as delusional, idiotic, self-righteous vigilantes. The Godpunk Gangs also dislike the Knights of the New Age exclusively on the basis that the Knights keep appearing on their turf to do good. The Gangs feel as though this "robs their thunder," but the Knights swear that none of them has ever conducted "theft of thunder, lightning, or other element of nature." Despite their differences, the Dreamscapers of Oneiros Dreamscapers seem fond of the Knights as a counter-balance to Saturday's enforcement of the law. Sometimes, Dreamscapers enter the minds of Knights at night and fill them with thoughts of cavalry charges on motorcycles, of slaying monsters with gunblades, and of neighbors who seem ok on the outside but who could use a Knight's hand—or blade—on the inside.
