A long time ago, there was a demon who mocked Kalighus. He said that Kalighus's place was "not sitting on a Throne for the gods but among the fiends of Inferno." Kalighus fretted not. He simply caught the demon and killed him. But the demon returned laughing. So, Kalighus caught him and killed him again. And the demon returned laughing again and again and again. The next time, Kalighus caught him and threw him into a dungeon so perversely isolated the demon's laughter would reverberate for an eternity—and no one else but the demon would ever hear it again. And whenever Kalighus found something that he couldn't kill or someone he wanted to break so thoroughly into submission, he'd throw it into a dungeon. And then into another, and another and another dungeon, until there were seven different little hell-holes crafted exclusively for Kalighus and the Compagnia to bend and break those who refused to yield or to understand that the God-Tyrant was absolute, and nothing—nor no one—would ever change that. But what if someone did? What, then, would remain of the dungeons? In the final throes of the rebellion, all but one of them fell under the weight of its own inmates. The last of these dungeons suffered not a collapse but a reversal of roles.

Welcome to Saturday Island, the penitentiary district of Labrys.

Saturday Island is a unique district—its foundation, however damned it is, already existed before Labrys. Much of the structure of the dungeon on the Island was reutilized in its transformation into a district. However, its residents—its former inmates—didn't want to live in it as it was. So, to reclaim the Island for themselves, the inmates made the walls bleed colors, and the once-silent halls howled with metal and rock. Bit by bit, the austerity of Saturday Island became the extremity it is today. Those who had known nothing but the dungeon since birth remained in it, as did those who wanted nothing but the monotonous continuance of life, now without the hateful hands of the Compagnia but instead the watchful eyes of Saturday. In this dungeon, there are no shackles but the weight of an inmate's sin. Climbing back to the surface or sinking into the dungeon's depths is a choice held in one's hands.

Saturday Island has two major neighborhoods, the Mictlan Quarter and the Tartarus Quarter, plus the headquarters of Saturday Saints Security, which is the gate to the deepest dungeon of the Island. Mictlan Quarter is a low-income neighborhood known for its collection of graffiti art depicting monstrous beings and eldritch entities. Sometimes, these depictions come to life and entice mortals into signing pacts—a method these entities found to communicate with potential warlocks despite the guards' surveillance. Tartarus Quarter, on the other hand, is a nicer neighborhood but one with a constant rush of outsiders, as it serves as the gate into the district. Inmates with light sentences can serve their time on the surface levels of the dungeon, working their time off doing community service. Some of them can even work at a regular job in other neighborhoods, though under the strict scrutiny of a Saturday agent.

### Saturday Saints Security

Remember Laurine, "the sole survivor of the First Flight?" She led a warband behind the shadows, using a puppet leader in her stead. I remember the look on her face when the others mentioned "building a place for the survivors." I had never seen a smile like that. She offered herself and the members of her warband to be the law enforcers, for who else knew better than "fairness" than a being made of it. Her warband dissolved into the Saturday Saints Security, often shortened to the S.S.S. or 3S. The S.S.S. became responsible for maintaining _the Rule of Law_ and for preserving peace in Labrys itself. The guards wear uniforms based on their stations. For instance, the guards of Public Security often wear black and white uniforms with checkered neckties. Those on Special Defense wear full black leather uniforms decked with chains and elegant, angelic detailings.

There's at least one Public Security Department building in every district, except for the Outer Ring, which houses the Special Defense Department building. The relationships between citizens and the guards vary depending on the district. For instance, the residents of Overlook Harbor don't mind the guards that much, despite some of them being dangerously skeptical of the district's hauntings and oddities. On Kings' Row, however, the guards follow not _the Rule of Law_ but "the Rule of Wealth," for their loyalty to the faction and to the people waxes and wanes depending on "how much is in it" for them at the moment.

Saturday Saints Security maintains a close relationship with the Gearheart Institute due to the Institute's doctors' willingness to work with the inmates of the deep dungeon, eldritch or otherwise. In exchange, the angels assist the doctors in their research of nonmagical healing. Some inmates also offer themselves up as test subjects in exchange for benefits at the dungeon, which is concerning for some—but not all—of the doctors. House Domino abhors the S.S.S., who often "stumble" on their illegal businesses at the worst moment possible. It doesn't matter too much since the House can cash in some "favors" and turn the guards' attention elsewhere (either to the Godpunks or the Sigilswarm since those factions cannot leverage the same kind of "favors" as them). Nonetheless, those are still resources the House could've spent on some other, much more interesting venture. PAЯADOX has a unique interest in the ancient artifacts and eldritch entities locked up in the deep dungeon and often offers to collaborate with the guards in hopes of getting access to them, with little to no success. But when something goes awry, who else in all of Labrys has as much expertise on the eldritch and the occult as them?
