Magic is a complicated thing. Kalighar had lost it for one thousand years, and when it returned, the Kalighari were far too eager to use it—and far too unaware of its dangers. So, as the townhouses gaze melancholically at the mist-shrouded beach, as the lights of the VTs flicker ominously in this languid, ordinary suburb, do know that something has taken advantage of our curiosity. And as it becomes close to midnight, something wicked comes out of the dark, writhing in the woods, hiding in your mind. Under the moonlight, your heart skips a beat, and you pray for it to not stop. Don't turn off the lights; the haunting's just about to start. 

Welcome to Overlook Harbor, the dockside district of Labrys.

Overlook Harbor is the second most populous residential district in Labrys. It's located on a big island with patches of woodland. The island is connected to Labrys by a bridge, but unlike Saturday Island, it doesn't have the same level of strict security since it is just a residential district. The district's dockside is always full of boats selling fish or ferrying imported goods into the market, and its amusement park is quite popular with kids and teens. Overlook is also the house of Sleepstone Institute, the sole college in all the Outlands. So, with all of this in mind, what is "the catch" of Overlook Harbor? Because it is a nice district, but the description at the start wasn't for naught.

Well, Overlook Harbor is haunted.

OK, haunted implies ghosts and other forms of Undead, which isn't the case. Well, rather, it's not just the Undead that haunt Overlook Harbor. Something slumbers in the depths of the Harbor, causing the district to slumber, too. Overlook Harbor becomes the casual, nice, and nostalgic little district it is. But when that something wakes up, so too do the Nightmares that lurk in people's minds. These monstrous manifestations of fear transform parts of Overlook into hauntscapes, places twisted with shadow magic. The night becomes longer and longer until the Nightmare is dealt with. Sometimes, people won't realize a place has become a hauntscape for weeks. Nightmares often choose uninhabited places that evoke certain emotions, such as abandoned cabins in the woods, old houses on the outskirts of town, or the mall after dark. The darkest corners of these places, where light doesn't touch, become hiding spots for the Nightmares, who wait until it's nighttime to come out and hunt for delicious mortal fear.

Nightmares seem to be intelligent enough to haunt specific kinds of mortals—those weak enough to be overwhelmed and manipulated, with delicious delusions of horror whose fears can be transformed into new monsters. Nightmares seldom attack old people. Guess "causing immediate heart attack" isn't as appetizing as "participating in a thrilling cat-mouse game with the mortal you're stalking." Some of the Overlook Harbor residents know well enough of the evil that lurks in their district and make it their mission to hunt these monsters down. Usually, these are teens and young adults with far too much free time. Others want to unravel the mystery behind all this evil, either to eradicate it or to harness it. Believe it or not, some people chase Nightmares and the hauntscapes out of morbid curiosity. If there's one thing Nightmares cannot seem to understand, it's that some mortals like to be afraid.

### Oneiros Dreamscapers

It was in 880 AR when one of the warbands developed radio waves, a remarkable piece of artifice that helped their members communicate with one another over short distances. Kalighus was fascinated with it, and with his intervention, the radio became another instrument of war used for military discussion. The warband that made it, of course, was thrilled that the God-Tyrant had liked it, but now that everyone else was using it...it was time to take advantage of it. That warband hijacked their opponents' radios and issued misleading commands, often weakening their base's security for long enough for them to ransack the whole place and disappear. Misinformation was the name of the game, and when it was time for Kalighus to taste a bit of their technique, the warband joined in on the fun. Their members called upon odd techniques, magic that wasn't magical, and pacts that had gone under Kalighus's notice for years. Kalighus called all the paladins of the Compagnia to defend Castle Decim, but not all of them came to his aid. He had called all of them! But so did someone else with the exact same voice. It's just that the meeting point was elsewhere. Bummer.

Nowadays, that warband calls itself Oneiros Dreamscapers, and their "magic-that-wasn't-magical" is what we call psionics. In defiance of the God-Tyrant's forbiddance of other forms of magic, the Dreamscapers found something that wasn't magic at all but rather something weird and unique. After the wars were over, the warband that would become the Dreamscapers seamlessly disappeared over the waves of people who came to Labrys. As Oneiros Dreamscapers, the faction has maintained much of its connection to psionics, but its attention has shifted a bit. They're interested in two metaphysical spaces—the dreamscapes and the hauntscapes. Dreamscapes appear to be limited metaphysical realities that emerge from a person's or community's collective consciousness. The Dreamscapers enter other people's dreamscapes and gain insight into them on a subconscious level. Depending on their relationship, the Dreamscapers either leverage this information for ill or for good. Hauntscapes, however, intrigue the Dreamscapers, who believe that some powerful shadow being or mage is behind them. Hauntscapes, as mentioned, are physical spaces that transform into memetic pastiches of horror. The Hauntscapes can teach a lot, too, but the danger of the Nightmares is one that not a lot of Dreamscapers are willing to face.

Regarding their front, the Oneiros Dreamscapers advertise themselves as a faction of "psychic psychologists," utilizing their abilities to unravel a person's psyche and delve into the root of their issues. Most of the time, the Dreamscapers honor their clients' privacy and do everything possible to help them resolve their mental health issues. Still, sometimes, the Dreamscapers find something so incredibly fascinating in their clients' minds that they can't help but pick "a piece of their mind" for later. The headquarters of Oneiros Dreamscapers, the Grand Anderson Hotel, is the culmination of their studies on dreamscapes and hauntscapes, as the hotel's metaphysics blurs the line between the physical and the mental. Those who stay in the hotel claim to leave with their minds clear of worry and doubt, with renewed resolve and a better sense of themselves. Some don't leave at all.

Out of all the major factions in Labrys, the Dreamscapers like PAЯADOX the most. The alienists of PAЯADOX deal with otherworldly entities that possess minds and thoughts that cannot be comprehended. But if the Dreamscapers could take a peek...oh, imagine how fun it'd be! PAЯADOX is wary of the Dreamscapers' whimsies. Still, as one of the few factions that actively help them understand the alien and the otherworldly, the alienists must sometimes accept a bit of whimsy in exchange for reliable lab partners. The doctors of Gearheart Institute, however, don't entertain the Dreamscapers' antics. In their opinion, the Dreamscaper's "psychic-logical sessions" are silly at best and dangerously harmful at worst. Weirdly, the Dreamscapers don't comment on it. The silence is, perhaps, the worst answer the Institute can ever get. House Domino has a vested interest in the Grand Anderson Hotel both as a business venture and as the headquarters of the Dreamscapers. So much knowledge inside those hotel rooms! Imagine the level of blackmail the Dreamscapers must engage in. But the Dreamscapers know not to make a deal with these devils. Their treachery leaves much more than just a few screws loose in its wake.
