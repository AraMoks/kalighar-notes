Most survivors who come to Labrys only ever think of its surface—the city that welcomes all who make it through the Outlands, who survived the Age of Wars with their sanity intact. Those people often go to the residential districts to build a new home for themselves. Yes, a home, with all the commodities Labrys has to offer—æther to fuel the machines, electricity to keep the lights on, and the best thing of all, plumbing. But how does it all work? Well, if you take a moment to see what lies underneath Labrys, you might find something truly fascinating. Imagine this—a thousand footsteps walking downstairs to a place unknown to the sun. A labyrinth of twisting tunnels welcomes all to the final resting place of the broken and discarded. Æther pumps through the pipes as electricity courses through the old machinery. Blessed be the blood of the artifice that keeps the city alight, and the artificers who keep it running.

Welcome to Junkyard Junction, the underworld district of Labrys.

Junkyard Junction is the tenth and final district of Labrys. Constructed in 060 NA, "the Junction" was the first subway station on Labrys, built by the crew of the _Mavromichalis 190_ to connect the city's districts through underworld tunnels. The Godpunk Gangs helped place it on an Artery that no longer exists. The first subway cars were constructed in the likeness of the _god-warmachina_, and they were very popular. The crew built over fifty tunnels, some of which were later abandoned due to construction complications. The popularity of "the Junction" was overwhelming. First came the passengers, thousands of them using the subway every day. Then came the sellers, who built stalls and small businesses to capitalize on the passengers. Then came the homeless, who built makeshift homes in those abandoned tunnels. And then the Artery and "the Junction" became one and the same—Junkyard Junction was its name, the final piece of Labrys's confusing puzzle.

"The Junction" became Junkyard Junction, as did every other subway station in Labrys. The districts assimilated much of the Artery until nothing but the station and its immediate vicinity remained. In response, the crew of the _Mavromichalis 190_, in conjunction with another major faction, helped build three "neighborhoods-on-rails," railyards for the residents of Junkyard Junction to build something that was theirs. The residents' cars rotate through each railyard, causing the district's "layout" to shift intermitently. Several artificers came to Junkyard Junction to assist with the city's infrastructural maintenance, but stayed for the opportunity to tinker with the district's own unique infrastructure. For example, the artificers made it so that the shifting of the "neighborhoods-on-rails" is semi-automatic. All it needs is for one designated resident to command the cars to go to the next railyard.

### Sigilswarm Market

Throughout the Age of War, the definition of "commercialization" changed between warbands. Some warbands commercialized resources, exchanging them for information or security. Others commercialized services in exchange for assistance in dealing with a common foe. Kalighus hated commerce, so he had the Compagnia persecute those who relied too much on it. The Compagnia hunted them to the point of extinction, but the rebellion managed to keep one of them safe and sound. This one warband, composed of crafters and negotiators, was instrumental in finding both the resources needed to destroy Castle Decim, the God-Tyrant's residence, and in persuading other warbands to join their cause. This warband didn't join the others in fighting the Compagnia directly. Instead, their members crawled beneath the Castle's foundation, placing bombs and detonating them to the sound of thunder. The reinforcement that waited inside didn't notice the explosions, but felt the sting of the daggers of the warband within. The rest of the rebellion opened the doors to Castle Decim and met not the Compagnia's reinforcements, but instead their dead bodies, and that war band, ransacking the place of all it was worth.

That warband became the Sigilswarm Market, a guild of artificers, finders, and negotiators who ran the first open-air market of Labrys circa 003 NA. The Sigilswarm ran their business in the Outer Ring, taking advantage of the crew of the _Mavromichalis 190's_ absence to act as its main faction. After the establishment of Junkyard Junction, however, the Sigilswarm was faced with a difficult choice—attempt to push the crew, who had been nothing but courteous to them, into that new district, or claim it to themselves. After an auspicious meeting with the then-chief conductor of the _Mavromichalis 190_, the Sigilswarm decided to relocate, setting up shop among the railyards and tunnels of the underworld district. Ever since then, the Sigilswarm Market has become almost synonymous with Junkyard Junction's myriad of businesses. It's one of the factions with the easiest entry points and the highest number of members. Nearly every business in the district is a part of the Sigilswarm. There's no item the Sigilswarm won't craft or find, no service that cannot be set or negotiated. Obviously, locals always receive some discount, but the Sigilswarm reserves its best deals for its most loyal customers.

Sigilswarm Market maintains a relationship of respect with all the factions—they're all potential clients, after all. But it has a special respect for the Godpunk Gangs, who, in addition to relinquishing an Artery to the first "Junction," continue to be excellent customers. That being said, no, their artificers cannot add ætherburners to the back of the Sigilswarm's rail cars to turn them into "sick, lightning-fast machines of urban rage." That's just not happening. On that note, the Sigilswarm keeps tabs on customers who frequently commission outlandish items and request unusual services. PAЯADOX is chief among those, ten requests for "pickled tentacles in platinum-inlaid jars," three requests for "fresh alien blood samples," and one request for "assisting in finding the lost spaceship _the Nemo_ among the wreckages in No Man's Land." To dissuade them and others, the Sigilswarm Market has added a special "PAЯADOX" fee on such requests. It hasn't helped that much, as PAЯADOX continues to send out crazy commissions. The guards of Saturday Saints Security view the Sigilswarm Market as a faction of outstanding citizens who look after the district and its local legal businesses and assist others with their minor worldly affairs. They're OK with the S.S.S. in the district, so long as the guards remain oblivious to the fact that the faction has some not-so-outstanding members conducting not-so-legal businesses and engaging in not-so-minor affairs. Sometimes, the local guards let the Sigilswarm get away with minor "slip-ups," after all, it's "per the course" for a faction as big as them.
