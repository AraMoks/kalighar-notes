It's a weird, wild world out there, with berserkers and demigods and monsters all trying to carve out inside out. That's why Labrys built those walls! It's to keep the dangers of the Outlands on the outside, of course. However, those who threaten Labrys won't be denied, and Labrys itself won't be contained within its walls. So, abandon all falsehoods and raise your weapon high. Topple these walls and see the weird, wild world that awaits you. Topple these walls and see that Labrys has changed, and Kalighar has changed too. Topple these walls and go to places no one has ever been to before. The Outlands await, and we mustn't delay.

Welcome to the Outer Ring, the frontier district of Labrys.

None of the warbands that built Labrys knew the size it'd take. One of those warbands, however, was gifted with a certain insight that, should Labrys become a major settlement, it'd be a good idea to build a place for it to expand without the constraints of a wall. That's how the Outer Ring came into being, a frontier district in an endless state of construction. Although it might be quite populous, it's sparsely populated, as people couldn't settle on a specific place to focus their construction efforts. Indeed, settlements come and go all the time in the Outer Rings—it all depends on the population's resolve to see it all through. Though Saturday Saints Security lends a hand through its "sheriff system," which is similar to how the guards in Labrys work but with a different, "Outer Rings" approach, this doesn't halt the threat of the Compagnia demigods, who see the Outer Ring as Labrys's most vulnerable district.

The Outer Ring has three major settlements—Bristleback Pass, Dead Man's End, and Route 88. Each of these three settlements was constructed with the assistance of a certain warband that wants to see Kalighar reborn in full bloom. Route 88 is chief among those, and is the Artery of the Outer Ring, connecting the Outlands to Labrys and vice versa. The Godpunks do look after Route 88 and its people, but the town has its own lawkeeper—a sheriff, who answers to the S.S.S. in times of routine inspection. The S.S.S.'s Special Defenses Department, located on the outskirts of Route 88, guards not the town but the Outlands themselves. The guards fight against cultists (Compagnia and otherwise) and monsters, and keep the advances of berserkers who might want to raid the Outer Ring settlements. Their building looms over Route 88, casting a shadow that is far too ominous and far too long for a place like the Outer Ring.

### Mavromichalis 190

Kalighus was not just a god of war; he was also a god of craftsmen. His most famous work was the _god-weapons_, of course, but what if I told you that among the one-thousand-and-one god-weapons he made, three of them weren't weapons at all, but something else. The _god-warmachinas_, machines of absolute destruction, raged through Kalighar in the Age of War. Two of them, the [_Black Sheep_](https://open.spotify.com/intl-pt/track/60TThBDrPpek5k520l0W0L?si=96bcb081bffe4acc "Black Sheep
(https://open.spotify.com/intl-pt/track/60TThBDrPpek5k520l0W0L?si=96bcb081bffe4acc)"), a warship, and the [_Pandæmonium_](https://open.spotify.com/intl-pt/track/2iPWJpLk0LF4iJyOqs4RzM?si=44707fec5cf949f2 "Pandæmonium
(https://open.spotify.com/intl-pt/track/2iPWJpLk0LF4iJyOqs4RzM?si=44707fec5cf949f2)"), an airship, were under the command of the Compagnia, but the third was an additional "prize" to be claimed at war. The third _god-warmachina_ was a nameless machine that blazed through the continent, destroying bases and scorching the land with molten rage. Kalighus liked to watch warbands fight over it. But his smile turned upside down when the rebellion got hold of it. He didn't see it, but he could feel it in his heart while waiting in the Elysian Fields, the moment the warband that took over the _god-warmachina_ rammed it against the walls of Castle Decim.

That warband became the crew of the _Mavromichalis 190_, named after the late leader and the first conductor of this mean machine. The crew trailblazes through the continent, constructing rails to connect the survivors of the wars back to the Outlands, to the Outer Ring, to Labrys—to home. Despite being the major faction in the Outer Ring, the crew of the _Mavromichalis 190_ spends most of its time in the farthest reaches of Kalighar. In times of need, the crew can return to the Outlands in a few hours, no matter the distance—one of the god-warmachina's perks; however, it risks the Mavromichalis 190 going off the rails, and once it does, no one in Kalighar can stop it.

The crew of the _Mavromichalis 190_ doesn't concern itself with the affairs of other factions, but it has some close allies among them. For instance, the Godpunks and the Sigilswarm both maintain close bonds to the crew due to their connections to the Outer Ring. One of their most unusual additions to their list of allies has been Starlight Studios. The faction has started showcasing "the Wonders of the New Age" in films and VT specials. The crew has been asked to film footage of some locations, or at least let their members catch a ride on the _Mavromichalis 190_ and film it themselves. The crew has no reason to not oblige. The crew has no actual enemies within the factions of Labrys, but since it is often outside its walls, it must be cautious of the Compagnia. The Compagnia wants all the _god-warmachinas_ back so it can launch an all-out attack against Labrys. Thus far, the Compagnia commands only _Pandæmonium_, but _Black Sheep_ and "the unnamed _god-weapon_" remain out of reach. In the comfort of their hotel, the Dreamscapers reach out to the crew, begging them to change their course and escape the impending doom that awaits all who face _Pandæmonium_ head-on. Like whispers in the wind, their mysterious benefactors' warnings go far, all so that sense of wonder that fills the Dreamscapers' hearts with glee doesn't burn like ashes.
