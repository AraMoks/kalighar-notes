So, do you understand our situation now? How we've come to be, and how we earned this title of "godslayers?" You do? Awesome! Now that our history lesson is over, it's time to learn a bit about the place you're staying: Labrys. Labrys is the de facto capital of Kalighar. 

Labrys is the most important settlement in the Outlands—a name we use for all the regions within Labrys's immediate reach. It's the new bed of civilization in the New Age, built by the survivors of the Great Wars in defiance to the Compagnia demigods, who lurk in the wilds tempting mortals to join their cults, all to fuel their ascension. Labrys is quite advanced in artifice, or so I've heard. Due to the disappearance of magic in the Age of Ruin, we had to learn how to make do. However, after its return at the turn of the New Age, we learned how to use it in conjunction with artifice to do wonders. 

The ten warbands that built Labrys acquiesced that her people shouldn't feel the need to pick one side of the whole over the other, but the leaders still wanted to feel as though each warband had claimed a corner of Labrys for themselves. That is how the ten districts came to be. Each warband claimed dominion over a district and contributed to its construction. Then came the factions, remnants of smaller warbands and splinters of the main ones, with their own agendas and ideals. So, instead of warbands, we had factions fighting for the spotlight. We'll get to them later.

So, how's Labrys as a city? Well, I'm glad you asked! I've compiled some information about it as a whole, and we'll review some details about the districts and factions at a later date.

Labrys is light on rules due to its history, but we still maintain some semblance of peacekeeping. And that is thanks to _the Rule of Law_, a magical document that is, in fact, Labrys's constitution. It was written by archangel Laurine Luther, the last angel of the "First Flight" of angels. She led her warband in the shadows, sabotaging the most hateful warbands and the god who plucked her wings. Hers was one of the first warbands to join the rebellion, and for her deeds, she ascended into archangelhood, the first and only of her kind in Kalighar. 

Laurine used her magic to write _the Rule of Law_ as a way to keep the citizens of Labrys and the many factions with it in check. The document, though light in rules, is imbued with hieromancy—law magic. Should someone break the law, Laurine and those under her wings can use _the Rule of Law_ to bind them in radiant light. Her warband dissolved into Saturday Saints Security (or the S.S.S), one of the ten major factions of Labrys who claim dominion over Saturday Island. Saturday's Public Security Department handles most minor cases, such as cheating and theft. They're everywhere in the city, not just on Saturday Island. In contrast, the Special Defense Department handles the most major cases, such as assault and manslaughter. Not all of the angels in Labrys claim allegiance to the S.S.S, but those who do join it as part of the Special Defense Department.

As previously mentioned, Labrys has ten governmental districts, each with its own quirks. Transit between each district is straightforward, as most districts intersect with one another. Those without a personal vehicle must walk, take a cab, or use one of Labrys' public transportation options, such as the bus or the subway. The bus is comfortable but unreliable, while the subway is the opposite. Most people opt for the subway, as it's the fastest. Due to its construction, every subway line passes by Junkyard Junction, attributing to its sense of constant activity.

Each district has some residential neighborhoods, which consist of several rowhouses constructed in similar shapes but painted in different colors. Up to three families can reside in the same household. Ætherwork facilities located in each district distribute sufficient æther and electricity for the district's residents, with one major exception: the Outlands district, which frequently suffers technical difficulties due to either a lack of maintenance or interference from æther- and electricity-devouring Elementals and Monstrosities.

Labrys is a monument to mortal resolve, and it is among the best things to come out of the New Age, but it is not a perfect place. Our workers still fight for better rights every day. Some bosses abuse the lightness of the laws to keep their workers toiling on end without fair compensation. Others don't offer safe work environments, which is cause for real concern in certain districts, chief among them being Zener Hazard. Elsewhere, in Carolina Boulevard, the situation is a bit different, as the district's elitism alienates those of poor income, pushing them off their neighborhoods and parks.
