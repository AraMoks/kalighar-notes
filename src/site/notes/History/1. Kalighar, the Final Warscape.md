Past the Wall of Starblades and the Whorl of Worlds lies a continent like no other in Vylward—the Final Warscape, the Land of Godslayers, the Outlands...of Kalighar! The Kalighar of yesteryears was once dominated by a God-Tyrant: Kalighus, the God of a Thousand Arms. This terrifying god of weaponsmithing and war plunged this land into a millennia-long war, all for his own amusement and dominance. However, through concerted effort, mortals slayed this evil god in combat and reclaimed the continent for themselves...or, at least, a part of it. Here are some important facts about Kalighar to help you better understand it—

  _**Kalighar is a Godless Realm.**_ Kalighus killed all other gods that once existed in this realm, and after his subsequent death, Kalighar lost all of its known gods. Instead of gods, most Kalighari place their faith in themselves and in the "whims of fate." Some others join cults dedicated to eldritch entities or to the Compagnia demigods—incomplete "deities" that were once Kalighus's most powerful paladins. Time will tell whether Kalighar will remain apostate or if a pantheon of the New Age will rise to the occasion.

  _**Æther is Æverything.**_ Kalighar is rich in æther, a magical substance used as fuel for most of Kalighar's machines and vehicles. It's also used to supplement spellcasting, which the Kalighari find difficult. Æther is the lifeblood of Kalighar and was instrumental in developing artifice. Æther is collected either as a gas or a liquid. It is then condensed and refined into a bluish substance used as fuel or ingested as a potion. Sometimes, the ritual of refinement causes the sudden appearance of an ætherborn, an Elemental being born of æther.

These Small objects transmit images and sound. However, after some students found a mysterious channel—Channel 100—people learned that VTs can also transmit whispers of the dead. Sometimes, ghosts manage to escape the land of the dead using the VTs as portals, though those ghosts appear glitched and twisted, perhaps as punishment for escaping their final rest or as a consequence of using cursed channels.

The Kalighari that used to fight for their gods' amusement now fight for their own. "The Tournament to End All Tournaments" is the cornerstone of the continent, a tournament set between multiple teams fighting it out in a sanctified stadium. People use all sorts of weapons to make themselves stand out. A Kalighari can turn even a vehicle into a bonafide weapon! The ultimate prize is "a _wish_ of the champions' soul." People participate both for the chance to win its ultimate prize and to showcase their legendary talents to a legendary crowd.

The Maelstrom is made of raw magic, and its winds can alter the composition of other beings, turning regular Beasts into Elemental mutants that inhabit the Outlands. The Maelstrom is Kalighar's source of mana, and its essence colors the winds of the continent in a myriad of colors. To outsiders, the Maelstrom is a ticking time bomb, but for the Kalighari, it is just the land's weapon should another would-be God-Tyrant try to hurt it as Kalighus once did.
