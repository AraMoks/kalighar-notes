The Compagnia paladins felt deep in their hearts and souls the death of their god. With one last push, the Compagnia pushed the rebel warbands back to "No Man's Land" and equipped all their members with Kalighus's _god-weapons_, no matter their skill or station. 

After the last of Kalighus's essence disappeared unto nothingness, the Elysian Fields descended to Kalighar. The ten warbands that the Frontier Brigade had managed to become allies with—the survivors of the Great Wars—walked into its battlefield to see what had become of the mortals who had raised their weapons high against a god—and won. The leaders recovered the Brigade's god-weapons and then returned to their turfs with newfound allegiances, not wanting to destroy what had been built during the rebellion but to rebuild the continent that had been lost to the wars. 

But something stirred in the continent itself. Without Kalighus's interference, the once desolate continent regained all of its colors. Mana returned in full bloom, but the different kinds of magic tangled with one another and caused a unique arcanometeorological anomaly—the Maelstrom. The Maelstrom appeared out of thin air like a sudden outburst of rage, but it was so much more. It was retribution against a millennia of pain. It raged through Kalighar, destroying temples and icons of Kalighus as though it had a mind of its own. Beasts that were caught in its wake transformed into Elemental monstrosities ready to defend their maker. The warbands knew not what to do with it other than to watch on in horror as it reshaped the land into what it is today. But the final nail to Kalighus's coffin happened not just to the land but to the Compagnia, Castle Decim, and the _god-weapons_.

The Maelstrom approached Castle Decim with fury and was met by the Compagnia's efforts to stall it out. But the Soul of Kalighar would not be denied deliverance. The Maelstrom engulfed Castle Decim in a swirl of raw, wild magic. The weaker paladins died, and their _god-weapons_ were thrown into the wilds, to be found at a later date. The most powerful paladins, however, were transformed into abominable, incomplete demigods fused to their own _god-weapons_—monsters stapled to the skin of the gods. The Maelstrom destroyed Castle Decim, reducing it to rubble and ruin, just like how Kalighus had reduced Kalighar to nothing in the Age of Ruin. The newborn Compagnia demigods escaped into the wilds, their bodies and minds entwined with bloodstained steel. In the deepest shadows of Kalighar, the Compagnia plotted to take over the land in their late god's stead.

As the Maelstrom settled over the ruins of Castle Decim, the rebel warbands returned to their attempts to rebuild civilization, but it was a difficult task. The other warbands, those that hadn't abandoned Kalighus's teachings, and the Compagnia demigods, who lurked in the shadows hoping to destroy them, were threats none of them could take on alone. The warbands returned to the Elysian Fields and decided to fight this fight together. The rebellion built their first settlement by the Fields' walls, and this settlement grew and grew until it became the very first city in the Kalighar of the New Age, a sanctuary for the survivors of the Great Wars: Labrys.

Inside the Elysian Fields, the warband leaders fought against one another to keep their resolve high. No longer needing to fight one another for survival, others joined in the competition, either to settle some small debacle or just for the fun of it. Thus had the first Tournament to End All Tournaments begun, a way for the Kalighari of the New Age to reclaim their warmongering ways and turn them into something that was theirs, not his. And every year, when the Elysian Fields felt like it, the champion of "the End Tournament" would get their _wish_ heard and realized. Thus did dictate the wheel of fate that now turned in the mortals' favor.

No matter what threat Labrys faces, be it a monster, a person, or a demigod, the fighters would be ready to take them head-on. The New Age had just started, and the Kalighar were going to make the most of it.
