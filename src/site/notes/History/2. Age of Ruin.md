Kalighus descended the Elysian Fields with War Machine in hand. He spun a tale of the other gods' undoing: "It didn't need to be fatal," he said, "but none of them refused to yield. Reason could not find them." As Kalighus had claimed "the Throne" he so desperately wanted, the mortals kneeled in supplication. But he wasn't satisfied. He had to do something, something big, something so thoroughly relentless that no one would ever dare to challenge his reign. And if someone were to, their failure would be naught but fated. 

Kalighus severed the land's connection to mana in secrecy, causing magic to slowly disappear off Kalighar. Only the faithful maintained access to magic. His faithful. He then poisoned the land so that resources would dwindle, causing people to turn to him for salvation. And he offered it with bloodstained hands. His first edict was to name himself "the God-Tyrant" and the sole ruler of Kalighar. He dissolved all civilizations and societies and banded people together into warbands to participate in his most awful, most perverse, most terrifying plan—"the Great Wars." 

"The Great Wars" were simple—a continental-scale war between all warbands. Kalighus hoped that, by turning the Kalighari into fearsome warmongers, his rule would remain absolute, and his domain would always be in full effect. On the dawn of the first day, Kalighus "blessed" each warband with a chest full of resources, such as medicine, rations, and weapon parts for crafting. There were a lot of resources, but not enough for the whole warband. One of these chests also contained a special artifact, the _vow of victory_, which was the sole way for a warband to "win" the war. Kalighus watched as the warbands fought against one another, trying to find the vow of victory with amusement. When it was time to announce the winning warband, he collected its most fearsome fighter and added to his retinue of loyal, warmongering paladins—the Compagnia.

The Compagnia included the loyal paladins of the Age of Gods, terrifying champions of the Age of Ruin, and some of Kalighus's clergy. These paladins helped Kalighus maintain "the Great Wars" for a thousand years, using his _god-weapons_ to eliminate potential opposition. No one knows how many of Kalighus's _god-weapons_ were in the hands of the Compagnia, but history suggests about 1 in every 50 paladins had one. With the Compagnia's assistance, Kalighus eliminated every icon of the other gods, and bit by bit, the "continent that was" disappeared under the weight of war. Kalighar was no longer a place for weaklings. 

"The Great Wars" lasted for about one thousand years. One thousand years of senseless destruction and unspeakable horrors committed in his name. But as the wheel of fate continued to turn, the time had come for him to face one of his own. In the scorched deserts of "No Man's Land," a small warband was about to rewrite the fate of this land. 

The Frontier Brigade never won a war. Its members mostly hunted and scavenged and occasionally raided other warbands for resources in times of scarcity. Most of them had lost much to the wars and wanted nothing but for them to stop. The Compagnia had time and again attempted to coerce them into acting on their raids, onto killing the other warbands that claimed the desert as their turf. But after a few close calls, the Brigade always seemed to be one step ahead of them. Rumor has it that a voice on the radio communicated with them, telling them to find a path to the Elysian Fields. In exchange for pursuing this lead, the voice told them of the Compagnia's activity in the desert. Hoping that the Elysian Fields would hold the answers to ending the wars, the Brigade traveled far and wide, climbing the highest mountains and riding the wildest æthertrails to reach the fabled coliseum.
    
Upon reaching the Elysian Fields, the Brigade found not the place of legends but a place of despair. The dead haunted the Fields, demanding "a rematch" against the one who had slain them: Kalighus. No one knows what happened afterward, but it's said that someone—or something—who inhabited the Fields made a pact with the Brigade and laid out the foundation for Kalighus's demise. The Brigade returned to the land with newfound resolve. Their skirmishers and snipers started hunting Compagnia paladins in the desert, using their aptitudes to debilitate and palm their _god-weapons_, an act that would certainly anger the God-Tyrant. The Brigade managed to steal ten _god-weapons_, each a symbol of the blossoming rebellion. Kalighus, though enraged, accepted their challenge to the rule and invited all other warbands to participate in the annihilation of the Frontier Brigade:

> "For this upcoming war, the rules will be different. The warband known as 'the Frontier Brigade' holds the *vow of victory* and several 'powerful' _god-weapons_, all for the taking. Hunt them and claim your victory."

Though he had turned all other warbands against them, the Brigade's resolve didn't waver. The Brigade accepted the _vow of victory_ and used it to their advantage. When the first warband came to claim it and their _god-weapons_, the Brigade offered to forfeit them in exchange for a moment of their time. Though suspicious, the warband's leader accepted and learned of the Brigade's findings at the Elysian Fields. The leader picked up a _god-weapon_, not to return it to Kalighus or to claim it for himself, but to join the rebellion.

As the Brigade continued to foil his attempts, Kalighus found himself desperate. After a thousand years of complacency, had he been bested? No. He couldn't. He wouldn't. But as he watched the rebellion amass ten warbands, he felt something he never thought he could. He felt fear. Kalighus picked up _War Machine_ and threw it to the heavens, causing the _ruinous ultimatum_ to color Kalighar's sky with the colors of revolt. Black and red swirls caused the war to reach its crescendo, pushing the rebellion to act now or fall to the same spell that had killed all the other gods in the realm.

The warbands closed in on Castle Decim, Kalighus's residence, and fought against his Compagnia paladins. Only the Brigade managed to enter Kalighus's inner sanctum. Still, as their members opened the door to meet their nemesis, Kalighus had vanished into a portal, onto the Elysian Fields, onto "the rematch." 

Kalighus waited for them at the center of the Elysian Fields, _War Machine_ in hand. The Brigade were mere mortals—how could he ever lose? But something in the Elysian Fields awakened as the Brigade joined the battlefield. A will to fight so ancient that it escaped Kalighus's senses. As the battle began, the magic of the Elysian Fields turned these would-be "mere mortals" into legends capable of matching Kalighus ten to one. Though he hit them and caused wounds no mortal should survive, the members kept on fighting. Kalighus called for his domain to aid him, but it was for naught. After all, was the Brigade not participating in this war too? The God of a Thousand Arms found himself overwhelmed by the mortals, and each one of the Brigade members stabbed him with their weapons a thousand times. As Kalighus's essence dissipated, he could only think of that moment of glory, that pool of blood he had found himself in then and now. He lost. 

Though Kalighus had been defeated, the _ruinous ultimatum_ threatened to throw the whole of Kalighar into a calamitous state. With the magic of the Elysian Fields vanishing and their life waning, the Brigade members looked heavenward and _wished_ only for one thing: "Let us fight to see another day, please." The members died shortly after, but something in the Fields heard their _wishes_, in a way. A pillar of intense, colorful lights rushed out of the Elysian Fields, illuminating Kalighar and pulling the _ruinous ultimatum_ onto itself. Shortly after, _War Machine_ broke into pieces, thus marking the end of this Age of Ruin.
